A web-app for playing, and rust-crate for solving, sliding-block puzzles like the [ones from the](https://layton.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Slide) [Professor Layton games](https://layton.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Sliding).

# Web-App
[Try it out!](https://lumi-a.github.io/sliding-blocks) Written in TypeScript ðŸš¬, the code is in the `www`-directory. You can also specify your own puzzles to play around with and have them be solved automatically using the shortest possible number of moves! This uses the rust-crate compiled to web-assembly.

# Solver
Written in rust ðŸ¦€, the code is in the top-level directory. To accommodate all the speedup-ideas I could think of, the code became quite complicated. If you'd like to understand what's going on, feel free to contact me, and I'll gladly explain it! At a very basic level:
- We imagine a graph, where the nodes are all the different legal block-configurations, and two nodes are adjacent if one block-configuration can be transformed into the other block-configuration by moving a single block.
- Call a block a "goal-block" if it appears in the goal-configuration, i.e. it has a goal-position it has to reach for the puzzle to be considered "solved".
- If there is only one goal-block, we essentially run BFS.

## Optimizations
- If we have two non-goal-blocks of the same-shape, their positions are interchangable. For instance, these three block-configurations in Ten-Step Solution are equivalent from a puzzle-solving perspective:
  ```
    A     A     A 
  11.   11.   22. 
  .22.  .33.  .33.
  .33.  .22.  .44.
   .44   .44   .11
   B     B     B  
  ```
  Thus, we can reduce the search-space by treating such block-configurations as equivalent. This can _not_ be applied to two goal-blocks of the same shape, or even to a goal-block and a non-goal-block of the same shape.
- It would take a lot of memory to store the coordinates each block occupies. We wouldn't lose any information if, at the beginning, we stored the shapes of the blocks somewhere, and then represent block-configurations only by the blocks' _offsets_ (relative to, say, the top-left-corner). We could then store the offsets of each block-_shape_ in a set, thus ensuring that two block-configuration that are equivalent (as described above) are treated as equivalent: Because the two sets would be equal.
- It would also be tedious to calculate whether a block is within-bounds, or intersects another block, by comparing their coordinates for intersection. We'll be running those checks a _lot_, so it'd pay off to pre-compute all the offsets at which a block is in-bounds, and all the offset-pairs for which two blocks intersect. Actually, we need not do that for every pair of blocks, but only for every pair of _shapes_.

Thus, block-states are represented by a vector of goal-block-offsets, and a vector of _sets_ of non-goal-block-offsets, where all the non-goal-block-offsets in a set correspond to blocks of the same shape.

Some smaller optimizations involve choosing clever data-structures and fast hash-functions.

TODO: For really difficult puzzles, it might make sense to use something like JIT, together with _arrays_ of goal-block-offsets, and _arrays_ of _sets_ (that are secretly (sorted?) arrays in disguise) of non-goal-block-offsets. This would mean more performance and less memory-use during the algorithm, at the cost of recompilation-time for every puzzle.


## Tighter ASTAR-heuristics
If you have any better ideas for ASTAR-heuristics (whether in the single-goal-block or multiple-goal-block case), please share them! Two ideas I had:
1. For every goal-block B, count how many other blocks it has to cross in order to reach its goal.
2. A relaxation of the first idea: For every goal-block B, imagine a new graph, where the nodes are the positions of B such that B is still in-bounds (but might intersect other blocks), and edges are movements of B by a single unit. Put costs on these nodes: If B is in a specific position, the cost of that node is:\
  \[For all other blocks B' that intersect B in that position, sum C(B')\],\
  where C(B') is a constant (that depends on the shape of B') such that the resulting heuristic is admissible. If you assume both B and B' to be connected (as subgraphs of â„¤Â²), I think you can choose C(B') as the diameter of Bâ¨­B' (as a subgraph of â„¤Â²), where Bâ¨­B' is the union of all (B+x) with (B+x)âˆ©B'â‰ âˆ… and xâˆˆâ„¤Â². I'm sorry for writing this so horribly, and haven't proven this as admissible.\
  With these costs, find the shortest weighted path from the current offset of B to its goal-position, e.g. using Dijkstra. After doing this for all goal-blocks B, take the minimum over all the values.

Both of these ideas are implemented in the `astar`-branch, but not used, because these heuristics turned out to be too slow to be practical. I'm also way less certain that they work correctly.

# Build-Instructions
## Web-App
Requires [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Go into the `www` directory, run:
- `npm install` for the initial setup,
- `npm run start` to serve the site locally
- `npm run build` to build the website with webpack into the `www/dist` directory.
- `npm run deploy` to deploy the website to github-pages. This automatically runs `npm run build` first.

## Solver
Requires [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and cargo. In the top-level directory, run:
- `cargo bench` to run benchmarks.
- `cargo test` to run tests.
- Compiling to wasm: First install [`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/), then run `wasm-pack build` in the top-level directory. This outputs into the `pkg`-directory, where the web-app then reads it from.
